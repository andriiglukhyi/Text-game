in the beginning the user enters their name, next they choose the light side or the dark side, then the user is given 10+ scenarios that they respond to.  Each choice has a morality point value attached.  at the end the user is evaluated and classed as either good, neutral or bad.  this is compared to their initial dark/light side choice and tells you whether you chose correctly.
